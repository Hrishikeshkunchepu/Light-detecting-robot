Raspberrypi3b+ is employed to perform computer vision algorithms. 

The Robot is constructed with one servomotor to change the direction of the front wheels.

Two DC motors along with motor driver circuit sn754410NE. The circuit diagram for motor driver is adapted from the datasheet already provided
